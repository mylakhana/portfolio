## 📊 Technical Details

### Filter Implementation
```typescript
const [projectFilters, setProjectFilters] = useState({
  status: "All",
  type: "All",
  platform: "All",
  technology: "All",
  client: "All"
});

// Filtering logic
data.projects.filter(project => {
  const matchesStatus = projectFilters.status === "All" || project.status === projectFilters.status;
  const matchesType = projectFilters.type === "All" || project.type === projectFilters.type;
  const matchesPlatform = projectFilters.platform === "All" || project.platform === projectFilters.platform;
  const matchesTech = projectFilters.technology === "All" || project.technologies.includes(projectFilters.technology);
  const matchesClient = projectFilters.client === "All" || (
    data.clients.find(c => c.name === projectFilters.client)?.id === project.clientId
  );
  return matchesStatus && matchesType && matchesPlatform && matchesTech && matchesClient;
})
```

### Color Opacity Implementation
```typescript
// Example for Expert level
bg: "bg-emerald-50/50 dark:bg-emerald-950/30"
