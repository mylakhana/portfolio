**Released**: March 4, 2021
**Status**: Discontinued (evolved into ShipTag)
**Platform**: Mobile App (iOS & Android)
**My Role**: Flutter Developer (Complete Recreation from Xamarin)

##### Project Overview

**What is Arsel?**

Arsel was Digital Commerce's first venture into domestic shipping services within Saudi Arabia. The name "Arsel" (أرسل) means "Send" in Arabic, reflecting the app's core purpose: enabling quick and easy shipment preparation with up to 70% savings on shipping costs.

**Core Concept**:
- Enable users to quickly prepare domestic shipments within Saudi Arabia
- Provide significant cost savings (70% compared to traditional shipping methods)
- Simplify the shipping process from signup to delivery
- Deliver packages within 24-48 hours to most locations

**Business Model**:
- Direct integration with Saudi Post (SPL) as the exclusive carrier
- Commission-based revenue from each shipment
- Value proposition: convenience + cost savings
- Target market: Individual shippers and small businesses in Saudi Arabia

**Key Features**:
- Quick mobile number-based signup (no lengthy registration)
- Google Maps integration for accurate address entry
- Courier selection from DHL, Aramex, and SMSA
- Instant shipping label generation
- Real-time shipment tracking
- Drop-off at nearest courier location
- Fast delivery (24-48 hours to most Saudi locations)

**Market Position**:
Arsel was positioned as a bridge between WS1 (international shipping/mail forwarding) and what would later become ShipTag (comprehensive multi-carrier domestic shipping platform). It represented Digital Commerce's strategic expansion into the domestic Saudi shipping market.

##### Initial State & Technology

**When I Joined the Project (2019)**:

The Arsel project had been initiated by the company using **Xamarin** as the mobile development framework. Here's what the initial state looked like:

**Existing Implementation**:
- **Framework**: Xamarin.Forms (cross-platform C# framework)
- **Backend**: PHP with Yii2 framework (same as WS1)
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **Single Carrier**: Exclusively integrated with Saudi Post (SPL)
- **API Integration**: Custom API connecting to Saudi Post systems
- **Development Stage**: Early alpha with basic functionality

**Challenges with Xamarin Implementation**:

By the time I got involved, the Xamarin version had several issues:

1. **Performance Problems**:
   - Slow app startup times (8-12 seconds)
   - Laggy UI interactions, especially on Android
   - Heavy memory consumption
   - Poor rendering performance

2. **Development Challenges**:
   - Limited developer expertise in Xamarin within the team
   - Difficult debugging process
   - Platform-specific bugs requiring native code
   - Long build times (especially for iOS)

3. **User Experience Issues**:
   - UI didn't feel native on either platform
   - Inconsistent behavior between iOS and Android
   - Limited design flexibility
   - Arabic RTL support was problematic

4. **Business Constraints**:
   - Single carrier (Saudi Post) limitation
   - No real-time tracking integration
   - Manual label generation process
   - Limited scalability for future carrier integrations

**The Turning Point**:

Having already successfully migrated WS1 from Xamarin to Flutter (September 2018 - early 2019), I had proven Flutter's capabilities. The management was now more receptive to the idea of recreating Arsel in Flutter, especially given the Xamarin version's persistent issues.

#### 5.1.3 WTE (Where To Eat)
**Timeline Sort**: 3 | **Sort**: 27
**Period**: 2019-2020 (Prototype/Side Project)
**Status**: Discontinued (WhatsApp Polls feature rendered it obsolete)
**Platform**: Mobile App (Flutter)
**My Role**: Solo Developer (Concept to Prototype)
**Type**: Internal Side Project / Proof of Concept

##### Project Overview

**What is WTE?**

WTE (Where To Eat) was a fun side project designed to solve a common problem among friends: the inability to decide where to eat. It was a voting application that allowed friends to create polls for restaurant selection, helping groups reach consensus quickly and democratically.

**The Problem It Solved**:
- Friends spending too much time deciding where to eat
- Indecisiveness in group dining scenarios
- Need for democratic decision-making among friends
- Quick consensus building for social gatherings

**Core Functionality**:
```
User Flow:
1. User creates a poll with multiple restaurant options
2. Shares poll link with friends
3. Friends vote for their preferred restaurant
4. Poll displays real-time voting results
5. Group makes final decision based on votes
```

**Key Features**:
- Create custom restaurant polls
- Add multiple restaurant options (with photos and descriptions)
- Real-time vote counting
- Share polls via link or messaging apps
- View poll results instantly
- Time-limited polls (optional expiry)
- Anonymous or named voting options
- Mobile-first design for on-the-go use

**Timeline Context**:
This project was prototyped **way before WhatsApp added its Poll feature**. At the time, there was no easy way to create quick polls within messaging apps. We identified this gap and built WTE as a standalone solution.

##### Project Outcome & Discontinuation

**Why We Stopped Development**:

In late 2020 / early 2021, **WhatsApp introduced its built-in Poll feature**, which effectively solved the same problem WTE was addressing. Since:
- WhatsApp has massive user adoption
- Users already use WhatsApp for group coordination
- The Poll feature was seamlessly integrated into existing chats
- No need to switch to a separate app

**We made the strategic decision to discontinue WTE development.** It was no longer viable to compete with a feature built into an app that everyone already uses daily.

**Value of the Project**:

Despite being discontinued, WTE was valuable for several reasons:

1. **Proof of Concept**: Successfully demonstrated ability to identify problems and build solutions
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Completed functional app in ~1 month
3. **Solo Development Experience**: Handled full stack development independently
4. **Market Timing Lesson**: Learned about market timing and competition from established platforms
5. **Technical Skills**: Enhanced Flutter and backend development skills
6. **Feature Validation**: The fact that WhatsApp implemented similar functionality validated our problem identification

##### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Real-Time Vote Synchronization**
- **Problem**: Ensuring all users see updated vote counts in real-time
- **Solution**: Implemented polling mechanism to refresh vote counts every few seconds; considered WebSocket implementation for future iterations

**Challenge 2: Share Functionality**
- **Problem**: Making it easy to share polls across different platforms
- **Solution**: Implemented deep linking with unique poll URLs that work across messaging apps and social media

**Challenge 3: User Experience**
- **Problem**: Making the app simple enough for quick, spontaneous use
- **Solution**: Streamlined UI to minimize steps between opening app and creating/voting on poll

**Challenge 4: Anonymous vs Named Voting**
- **Problem**: Deciding whether votes should be anonymous or attributed
- **Solution**: Made it configurable per poll, allowing poll creator to choose

##### Key Learnings

**Technical Learnings**:
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Learned to quickly validate ideas with working prototypes
- **Real-Time Features**: Gained experience with real-time data synchronization challenges
- **Share Functionality**: Understood deep linking and cross-platform sharing mechanisms
- **Minimalist Design**: Practiced creating focused, single-purpose applications

**Product & Business Learnings**:
- **Market Timing**: Understanding that timing matters as much as the idea
- **Platform Competition**: Recognizing when established platforms can quickly replicate your solution
- **Knowing When to Pivot**: Learning to accept when external factors make a project non-viable
- **Problem Validation**: Seeing a major platform implement similar functionality validated our problem identification skills

**Personal Growth**:
- **Solo Development**: Built confidence in handling full-stack projects independently
- **Pragmatic Decision-Making**: Learned to make rational decisions about project continuation
- **Side Project Management**: Understood how to balance side projects with main responsibilities

**Quote Worth Remembering**:
> "We built WTE before WhatsApp Polls existed. While the project was discontinued, the fact that WhatsApp implemented the exact feature we envisioned validated that we correctly identified a real user need. Sometimes the best ideas aren't about being first—they're about being right about the problem."

##### Flutter Recreation

**The Decision to Rebuild (December 2021)**

In December 2021, after Arsel had been operating for ~2 years, management made the strategic decision to:
1. Rebrand Arsel → ShipTag
2. Expand from single carrier to multi-carrier hub
3. Rebuild entire platform from ground up
4. Modernize tech stack across mobile, web, and backend

**Why Complete Rebuild vs. Evolution?**

Several factors justified starting from scratch:

1. **Flutter Version Jump**:
   - Arsel built on Flutter 2.x (early 2019-2020 era)
   - Flutter 3.x available with major improvements
   - Null safety migration would require significant refactoring
   - Better to start fresh with latest best practices

2. **Architecture Limitations**:
   - Arsel designed for single carrier (tight coupling)
   - Multi-carrier needs required different architecture
   - Needed abstraction layers not present in Arsel
   - State management approach needed modernization

3. **Backend Complete Rewrite**:
   - Backend moving from PHP Yii2 → Node.js NestJS
   - Database migration from SQL Server → PostgreSQL
   - API contracts completely changing
   - Mobile app couldn't reuse existing integration code

4. **Design System Evolution**:
   - New brand identity (ShipTag vs Arsel)
   - Modern Material Design 3 principles
   - Improved user experience based on learnings
   - Better design consistency requirements

5. **Feature Set Expansion**:
   - Multi-carrier comparison and selection
   - Advanced tracking across different carrier systems
   - Business client features (bulk operations, analytics)
   - Storage and warehouse management
   - Payment collection systems

6. **Business Opportunity**:
   - Clean slate to "do it right"
   - Apply 4+ years of mobile dev learnings
   - Leverage latest Flutter ecosystem packages
   - Build for scale from day one

**My Role in Rebuild Decision**:

As the only mobile developer and having owned Arsel's Flutter development, I:

```
Presentation Layer (UI)
    ↓
Business Logic Layer (BLoC/State Management)
    ↓
Repository Layer (Data abstraction)
    ↓
Data Source Layer (API, Local Storage)
    ↓
External Services (Carriers, Firebase, etc.)
```

**2. Carrier Abstraction**:
```dart
// Abstract carrier interface
abstract class CarrierService {
  Future<ShipmentQuote> getQuote(ShipmentRequest request);
  Future<Shipment> createShipment(ShipmentDetails details);
  Future<TrackingInfo> trackShipment(String trackingNumber);
  Future<ShippingLabel> generateLabel(String shipmentId);
}

// Each carrier implements interface
class AramexService implements CarrierService { ... }
class DHLService implements CarrierService { ... }
class SMSAService implements CarrierService { ... }
// etc.
```

**3. State Management**:
- Switched from Provider (Arsel) to **BLoC pattern**
- Better separation of business logic

```dart
// Example: Optimized image loading
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: shipment.packageImage,
  placeholder: (context, url) => Shimmer.fromColors(
    baseColor: Colors.grey[300]!,
    highlightColor: Colors.grey[100]!,
    child: Container(color: Colors.white),
  ),
  errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
  maxHeightDiskCache: 500,
  maxWidthDiskCache: 500,
  memCacheHeight: 200,
  memCacheWidth: 200,
)

// Example: Pagination for lists
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: shipments.length + 1,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    if (index == shipments.length) {
      // Load more trigger
      context.read<ShipmentBloc>().add(LoadMoreShipments());
      return LoadingIndicator();
    }
    return ShipmentTile(shipment: shipments[index]);
  },
)

// Example: Debouncing search
TextField(
  onChanged: (value) {
    context.read<SearchBloc>().add(
      SearchTextChanged(value),
    );
  },
)

// In BLoC:
on<SearchTextChanged>(
  (event, emit) async {
    emit(SearchLoading());
    final results = await searchUseCase(event.query);
    emit(SearchLoaded(results));
  },
  transformer: restartable(),
  // Auto-debounce with 300ms delay
  transformer: (events, mapper) {
    return events
        .debounceTime(Duration(milliseconds: 300))
        .switchMap(mapper);
  },
);
```

##### Challenges Faced

**Technical Challenges**:

**1. Multi-Carrier Integration Complexity**:

**Challenge**: Each carrier has completely different API structure, authentication, data formats, and business rules.

| Carrier | API Type | Auth Method | Response Format | Complexity |
|---------|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Aramex | SOAP | Username/Password | XML | High |
| DHL | REST | OAuth 2.0 | JSON | Medium |
| SMSA | REST | API Key | JSON | Medium |
| J&T | REST | Signature-based | JSON | High |
| UPS | REST | OAuth | JSON | Medium |
| FedEx | REST | API Credentials | JSON | Medium |
| SPL | REST | Custom Token | JSON | High |

**Specific Issues**:
- **Inconsistent Data Models**: Address formats, package dimensions, weight units all different
- **Different Error Handling**: Each carrier returns errors differently
- **Rate Limiting**: Each carrier has different rate limits
- **Authentication Refreshing**: Managing token refresh for multiple carriers
- **Testing Difficulty**: Sandbox environments not always reliable
- **Documentation Quality**: Varied from excellent (DHL) to poor (some regional carriers)
- **API Versioning**: Some carriers deprecated APIs with little notice

**2. Real-Time Tracking Synchronization**:

**Challenge**: Unifying tracking from 7+ carriers into single, real-time view.

**Issues**:
- **Different Update Frequencies**: Carriers update at different intervals
- **Webhook Support**: Not all carriers support webhooks
- **Polling Strategy**: Had to poll some carriers, increasing server load
- **Event Standardization**: "Out for Delivery" vs "In Transit" vs "On Vehicle" - mapping to unified status
- **Delayed Updates**: Some carriers lag 2-4 hours in updating status
- **Historical Data**: Fetching complete shipment history across carriers
- **Network Failures**: Handling when carrier API is down temporarily

**3. State Management at Scale**:

**Challenge**: Managing complex state for multi-carrier, multi-shipment operations.

**Complexity**:
- Shipment list state (filters, sorting, pagination)
- Individual shipment details state
- Carrier selection and comparison state
- Form state for creating shipments
- Address book state
- Payment state
- User preferences and settings
- Offline queue state
- Background sync state

**Issues**:
- **State Synchronization**: Mobile app state vs backend state
- **Optimistic Updates**: Showing changes before server confirms
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling stale data
- **Performance**: Large state trees affecting performance
- **Debugging**: Complex state flows hard to debug

**4. Offline Functionality**:

**Challenge**: App should work when user has poor/no internet connection.

**Requirements**:
- View previously loaded shipments
- Queue create shipment requests
- Cache tracking information
- Store draft shipments
- Sync when connection restored

**Issues**:
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring local and remote data match
- **Conflict Resolution**: User modifies same shipment offline and online
- **Storage Limits**: Mobile devices have limited storage
- **Sync Strategy**: When to sync, what to sync
- **User Communication**: Clearly showing what's synced vs. pending

**5. Performance on Low-End Devices**:

**Challenge**: Saudi market has many budget Android devices (1-2GB RAM).

**Performance Targets**:
- Cold start: <2 seconds
- Screen transitions: 60fps
- List scrolling: 60fps smooth
- Memory: <150MB
- App size: <30MB

**Issues**:
- **Memory Leaks**: Preventing memory buildup
- **Image Loading**: Large shipment images
- **List Performance**: Hundreds of shipments
- **Animation Performance**: Smooth transitions
- **Build Size**: Including 7+ carrier SDKs increasing size

**6. Arabic/RTL Excellence**:

**Challenge**: Perfect right-to-left layout and Arabic language support.

**Issues**:
- **Layout Mirroring**: All screens must mirror for RTL
- **Mixed Content**: Arabic text with English numbers/English carrier names
- **Icon Direction**: Some icons should mirror, others shouldn't
- **Text Alignment**: Complex alignment rules
- **Date/Time Formatting**: Arabic calendar support
- **Font Rendering**: Arabic fonts not rendering consistently
- **Input Direction**: Text inputs switching direction
- **Animations**: Transitions need to work in RTL

**7. Payment Integration Security**:

**Challenge**: Handling sensitive payment data securely in mobile app.

**Requirements**:
- PCI DSS compliance
- Secure card data handling
- No storing sensitive data locally
- Secure communication with payment gateway
- 3D Secure support

**Issues**:
- **Token Management**: Secure token storage
- **Network Security**: HTTPS, certificate pinning
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypting sensitive data
- **Session Management**: Payment session timeouts
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages without exposing details
- **Platform Differences**: iOS vs Android security features

**8. Deep Linking & Navigation**:

**Challenge**: Users should open app from notifications, emails, SMS with context.

**Requirements**:
- Push notification → Specific shipment screen
- Email link → Tracking screen
- SMS link → Payment screen
- Social share → App download or deep link

**Issues**:
- **iOS Universal Links**: Complex setup and verification
- **Android App Links**: Requires domain verification
- **Deferred Deep Links**: Install app, then navigate
- **Navigation Stack**: Ensuring proper back navigation
- **Authentication**: Deep link while logged out

**Business & UX Challenges**:

**9. Carrier Selection UX**:

**Challenge**: Help users choose best carrier without overwhelming them.

**Issues**:
- **Too Many Options**: 7 carriers can be overwhelming
- **Price vs Speed**: Users want cheap AND fast
- **Service Areas**: Not all carriers serve all areas
- **Reliability**: How to communicate carrier reliability
- **Recommendations**: Should we recommend a carrier?

**10. Bulk Operations for Businesses**:

##### Solutions Implemented

**Technical Solutions**:

**1. Carrier Abstraction Layer**:

Solved the multi-carrier integration complexity with a unified interface:

```dart
// Abstract carrier interface
abstract class CarrierService {
  String get carrierId;
  String get carrierName;

  Future<QuoteResult> getQuote(QuoteRequest request);
  Future<ShipmentResult> createShipment(ShipmentRequest request);
  Future<TrackingResult> trackShipment(String trackingNumber);
  Future<LabelResult> generateLabel(String shipmentId);
  Future<bool> cancelShipment(String shipmentId);
  Future<List<ServiceArea>> getServiceAreas();
}

// Carrier factory
class CarrierFactory {
  static CarrierService getCarrier(String carrierId) {
    switch (carrierId) {
      case 'aramex': return AramexService();
      case 'dhl': return DHLService();
      case 'smsa': return SMSAService();
      case 'jt': return JTExpressService();
      case 'ups': return UPSService();
      case 'fedex': return FedExService();
      case 'spl': return SaudiPostService();
      default: throw UnsupportedCarrierException(carrierId);
    }
  }
}

// Usage - carrier-agnostic code
class ShipmentUseCase {
  Future<ShipmentResult> createShipment(
    String carrierId,
    ShipmentRequest request,
  ) async {
    final carrier = CarrierFactory.getCarrier(carrierId);
    return await carrier.createShipment(request);
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Add new carriers by implementing interface
- Swap carriers transparently
- Test with mock carriers
- Maintain carrier-specific code separately

**2. Unified Tracking Status**:

Created standard tracking status mapping:

```dart
enum ShipmentStatus {
  created,
  pickupRequested,
  pickedUp,
  inTransit,
  outForDelivery,
  delivered,
  failed,
  cancelled,
  returned,
}

// Carrier-specific to unified mapping
class TrackingMapper {
  static ShipmentStatus mapAramexStatus(String status) {
    switch (status.toLowerCase()) {
      case 'sht': return ShipmentStatus.created;
      case 'pkp': return ShipmentStatus.pickedUp;
      case 'ot': return ShipmentStatus.inTransit;
      case 'ofd': return ShipmentStatus.outForDelivery;
      case 'ok': return ShipmentStatus.delivered;
      // ... more mappings
    }
  }

  // Similar for DHL, SMSA, etc.
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent UI across carriers
- Easy to add new carriers
- Clear status for users

**3. BLoC Pattern for State Management**:

Implemented BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern:

```dart
// Shipment List BLoC
class ShipmentListBloc extends Bloc<ShipmentListEvent, ShipmentListState> {
  final GetShipmentsUseCase getShipments;

  ShipmentListBloc({required this.getShipments})
      : super(ShipmentListInitial()) {

    on<LoadShipments>(_onLoadShipments);
    on<RefreshShipments>(_onRefreshShipments);
    on<LoadMoreShipments>(_onLoadMoreShipments);
    on<FilterShipments>(_onFilterShipments);
  }

  Future<void> _onLoadShipments(
    LoadShipments event,
    Emitter<ShipmentListState> emit,
  ) async {
    emit(ShipmentListLoading());

    final result = await getShipments(page: 1);

    result.fold(
      (failure) => emit(ShipmentListError(failure.message)),
      (shipments) => emit(ShipmentListLoaded(
        shipments: shipments,
        hasMore: shipments.length >= 20,
      )),
    );
  }

  // ... other event handlers
}

// UI Layer
class ShipmentListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BlocBuilder<ShipmentListBloc, ShipmentListState>(
      builder: (context, state) {
        if (state is ShipmentListLoading) {
          return LoadingIndicator();
        } else if (state is ShipmentListLoaded) {
          return ShipmentList(shipments: state.shipments);
        } else if (state is ShipmentListError) {
          return ErrorWidget(message: state.message);
        }
        return SizedBox.shrink();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of business logic and UI
- Easy testing (test BLoCs independently)
- Predictable state changes
- Better debugging

**4. Offline Queue with Sync**:

Implemented offline-first architecture:

```dart
class OfflineQueueService {
  final LocalDatabase db;
  final NetworkInfo network;

  // Queue operation when offline
  Future<void> queueShipmentCreation(ShipmentRequest request) async {
    await db.insertPendingOperation(
      PendingOperation(
        id: uuid.v4(),
        type: OperationType.createShipment,
        data: request.toJson(),
        timestamp: DateTime.now(),
        retryCount: 0,
      ),
    );
  }

  // Process queue when online
  Future<void> processQueue() async {
    if (!await network.isConnected) return;

    final pending = await db.getPendingOperations();

    for (final operation in pending) {
      try {
        await _processOperation(operation);
        await db.deletePendingOperation(operation.id);
      } catch (e) {
        await db.updateRetryCount(operation.id);
        if (operation.retryCount > 3) {
          // Mark as failed, notify user
          await db.markOperationFailed(operation.id);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// Automatic sync when network restored
class NetworkListener {
  void init() {
    Connectivity().onConnectivityChanged.listen((result) {
      if (result != ConnectivityResult.none) {
        // Network restored
        getIt<OfflineQueueService>().processQueue();
      }
    }); }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- App works offline
- No lost data
- Automatic sync
- Clear pending status for users

**5. Performance Optimization**:

Multiple strategies for fast app performance:

**a) Image Optimization**:
```dart
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: shipment.image,
  maxHeightDiskCache: 500,
  maxWidthDiskCache: 500,
  memCacheHeight: 200,
  memCacheWidth: 200,
  placeholder: (context, url) => ShimmerPlaceholder(),
  errorWidget: (context, url, error) => DefaultImage(),
)
```

**b) List Optimization**:
```dart
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: shipments.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return ShipmentTile(
      key: ValueKey(shipments[index].id),
      shipment: shipments[index],
    );
  },
  // Lazy building
  cacheExtent: 500.0,
)
```

**c) Build Optimization**:
```dart
// Prevent unnecessary rebuilds
class ShipmentTile extends StatelessWidget {
  final Shipment shipment;

  const ShipmentTile({
    Key? key,
    required this.shipment,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Only rebuilds when shipment changes
    return Card(...);
  }
}
```

**d) Code Splitting**:
```dart
// Lazy load heavy screens
final route = MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (context) => FutureBuilder(
    future: _loadAnalyticsScreen(),
    builder: (context, snapshot) {
      if (snapshot.hasData) {
        return snapshot.data!;
      }
      return LoadingScreen();
    },
  ),
);
```

**6. RTL Layout System**:

Comprehensive RTL support:

```dart
class RTLHelper {
  static TextDirection get textDirection {
    final locale = Localizations.localeOf(context);
    return locale.languageCode == 'ar'
        ? TextDirection.rtl
        : TextDirection.ltr;
  }

  static EdgeInsets paddingStart(double value) {
    return EdgeInsetsDirectional.only(start: value);
  }

  static Alignment alignmentStart() {
    return AlignmentDirectional.centerStart;
  }
}

// Use directional widgets
Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsetsDirectional.only(start: 16, end: 8),
  child: Row(
    children: [
      Icon(Icons.arrow_forward), // Auto-flips in RTL
      Spacer(),
      Text('المزيد'),
    ],
  ),
)

// Directional icons
Icon(
  textDirection == TextDirection.rtl
      ? Icons.arrow_back
      : Icons.arrow_forward
)
```

**7. Secure Payment Implementation**:

PCI-compliant payment handling:

```dart
class PaymentService {
  // Never store card data locally
  Future<PaymentResult> processPayment({
    required double amount,
    required String currency,
  }) async {
    // 1. Get payment token from secure gateway
    final token = await _getPaymentToken();

    // 2. Show secure payment sheet (handled by gateway SDK)
    final paymentMethod = await _showPaymentSheet(token);

    // 3. Confirm payment with backend
    final result = await _apiClient.confirmPayment(
      token: token,
      paymentMethod: paymentMethod,
      amount: amount,
    );

    return result;
  }

  // Stored payment methods use tokenization
  Future<List<PaymentMethod>> getSavedPaymentMethods() async {
    // Returns tokens only, not actual card data
    return await _apiClient.getPaymentMethods();
  }
}

// Security measures
class SecurityConfig {
  // Certificate pinning
  static final certificatePinning = CertificatePinning(
    certificates: {
      'api.shiptag.com': [
        'sha256/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=',
      ],
    },
  );

  // Encrypted secure storage
  static final secureStorage = FlutterSecureStorage();
}
```

**8. Deep Linking Solution**:

Comprehensive deep linking for notifications and marketing:

```dart
class DeepLinkService {
  void init() {
    // iOS Universal Links & Android App Links
    _handleInitialLink();
    _handleIncomingLinks();
  }

  Future<void> _handleInitialLink() async {
    // App opened from terminated state
    final initialLink = await getInitialLink();
    if (initialLink != null) {
      _navigateToScreen(initialLink);
    }
  }

  void _handleIncomingLinks() {
    // App opened from background
    linkStream.listen((link) {
      if (link != null) {
        _navigateToScreen(link);
      }
    });
  }

  void _navigateToScreen(String link) {
    final uri = Uri.parse(link);

    // shiptag.com/shipment/ABC123
    if (uri.path.startsWith('/shipment/')) {
      final shipmentId = uri.pathSegments.last;
      navigatorKey.currentState?.pushNamed(
        '/shipment-details',
        arguments: shipmentId,
      );
    }

    // shiptag.com/track/ABC123
    else if (uri.path.startsWith('/track/')) {
      final trackingNumber = uri.pathSegments.last;
      navigatorKey.currentState?.pushNamed(
        '/track',
        arguments: trackingNumber,
      );
    }
  }
}

// Firebase Dynamic Links for install attribution
class DynamicLinkService {
  Future<void> handleDynamicLink() async {
    // Get initial dynamic link
    final PendingDynamicLinkData? data =
        await FirebaseDynamicLinks.instance.getInitialLink();

    _handleDeepLink(data?.link);

    // Listen for incoming dynamic links
    FirebaseDynamicLinks.instance.onLink.listen((data) {
      _handleDeepLink(data.link);
    });
  }
}
```

**Business & UX Solutions**:

**9. Smart Carrier Recommendation**:

Help users choose best carrier:

```dart
class CarrierRecommendationEngine {
  CarrierQuote recommendCarrier(
    List<CarrierQuote> quotes,
    UserPreferences prefs,
    ShipmentDetails shipment,
  ) {
    // Score each carrier
    final scored = quotes.map((quote) {
      var score = 0.0;

      // Price factor (40%)
      final priceScore = _calculatePriceScore(quote, quotes);
      score += priceScore * 0.4;

      // Speed factor (30%)
      final speedScore = _calculateSpeedScore(quote);
      score += speedScore * 0.3;

      // Reliability factor (20%)
      final reliabilityScore = quote.carrier.reliabilityRating / 5.0;
      score += reliabilityScore * 0.2;

      // User preference factor (10%)
      if (quote.carrierId == prefs.preferredCarrier) {
        score += 0.1;
      }

      return ScoredQuote(quote: quote, score: score);
    }).toList();

    // Sort by score
    scored.sort((a, b) => b.score.compareTo(a.score));

    // Return top recommendation
    return scored.first.quote;
  }
}

// UI shows recommendation
CarrierList(
  quotes: quotes,
  recommended: recommendedQuote,
  child: CarrierTile(
    quote: recommendedQuote,
    badge: RecommendedBadge(), // Highlighted
  ),
)
```

**10. Bulk CSV Import**:

Efficient bulk shipment creation:

```dart
class BulkImportService {
  Stream<ImportProgress> importShipments(File csvFile) async* {
    final rows = await _parseCsv(csvFile);
    var processed = 0;
    var successful = 0;
    var failed = 0;
    final errors = <ImportError>[];

    for (final row in rows) {
      try {
        // Validate row
        final shipment = _validateAndParse(row);

        // Create shipment
        await _shipmentService.createShipment(shipment);

        successful++;
      } catch (e) {
        failed++;
        errors.add(ImportError(
          row: processed + 1,
          data: row,
          error: e.toString(),
        ));
      }

      processed++;

      // Emit progress
      yield ImportProgress(
        total: rows.length,
        processed: processed,
        successful: successful,
        failed: failed,
        errors: errors,
      );
    }
  }
}

// UI shows progress
BlocBuilder<BulkImportBloc, BulkImportState>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is ImportInProgress) {
      return Column(
        children: [
          LinearProgressIndicator(
            value: state.progress.processed / state.progress.total,
          ),
          Text('${state.progress.processed} / ${state.progress.total}'),
          Text('✓ ${state.progress.successful} successful'),
          Text('✗ ${state.progress.failed} failed'),
        ],
      );
    }
    return SizedBox.shrink();
  },
)
```

**11. Feature Flags for Gradual Rollout**:

Safe feature deployment:

```dart
class FeatureFlags {
  final RemoteConfig remoteConfig;

  bool isFeatureEnabled(String featureName) {
    return remoteConfig.getBool(featureName);
  }

  // Usage
  if (featureFlags.isFeatureEnabled('storage_service')) {
    return StorageTab();
  }
}

// A/B testing
class ABTestingService {
  String getVariant(String testName) {
    final userId = getCurrentUserId();
    final variant = _consistentHash(userId, testName) % 2;
    return variant == 0 ? 'control' : 'variant';
  }
}
```

**12. Comprehensive Error Handling**:

User-friendly error messages:

```dart
class ErrorHandler {
  static String getUserFriendlyMessage(Exception error) {
    if (error is NetworkException) {
      return 'يرجى التحقق من اتصال الإنترنت';
    } else if (error is ValidationException) {
      return error.message;
    } else if (error is CarrierException) {
      return 'عذراً، هناك مشكلة مع شركة الشحن. يرجى المحاولة لاحقاً';
    } else {
      return 'حدث خطأ غير متوقع. يرجى المحاولة مرة أخرى';
    }
  }

  static void showError(BuildContext context, Exception error) {
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(
        content: Text(getUserFriendlyMessage(error)),
        action: error is RetryableException
            ? SnackBarAction(
                label: 'إعادة المحاولة',
                onPressed: () => error.retry(),
              )
            : null,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

These solutions transformed ShipTag from a complex technical challenge into a smooth, reliable, user-friendly app that thousands of users trust daily for their shipping needs.

#### 5.1.5 Camillion (2021)
**Timeline Sort**: 5 | **Sort**: 3
**Period**: 2021 (Development and Launch)
**Released**: November 25, 2021
**Status**: Live
**Platform**: Mobile App (iOS & Android)
**My Role**: Mobile Developer (Flutter)

##### Project Overview

**What is Camillion?**

Camillion is a cross-border shopping facilitation mobile application designed to simplify international online shopping for customers in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region. The app serves as a companion tool for shoppers who want to purchase from international online brands while understanding the true cost of their purchases including taxes, customs fees, and shipping.

**Core Purpose**:
> "Camillion is the easiest and fastest way to shop from online brands. Camillion gives you access to your favorite brands. Calculate Taxes, Custom Fees all within a few clicks."

**Problem It Solves**:

When shopping from international online stores (Amazon US, eBay, AliExpress, etc.) to Saudi Arabia, customers face several challenges:

1. **Hidden Costs**: The displayed product price doesn't include:
   - Import customs duties (typically 5-15%)
   - VAT (15% in Saudi Arabia)
   - Shipping costs
   - Currency conversion fees
   - Handling fees

2. **Price Uncertainty**: Customers can't accurately budget for international purchases

3. **Calculation Complexity**: Manual calculation of duties and taxes is tedious and error-prone

4. **Currency Conversion**: Real-time exchange rates affect final price

5. **Product Category Rules**: Different product categories have different duty rates

**Camillion's Solution**:

The app provides:
- **Instant Cost Calculation**: Calculate total landed cost before purchase
- **Comprehensive Breakdown**: See taxes, customs, shipping separately
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Convert between currencies with live rates
- **Product Category Database**: Accurate duty rates for various product types
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, quick calculations
- **Shopping Lists**: Save calculations for comparison
- **Purchase Decision Tool**: Know exact cost before committing to buy

**Target Users**:
- Saudi and Gulf region online shoppers
- WS1 customers (mail forwarding service users)
- Frequent international shoppers
- Business importers
- Anyone shopping from global e-commerce sites

**Business Context**:

Camillion was developed as a complementary service to Digital Commerce's existing WS1 mail forwarding service. While WS1 provides a US address for shopping, Camillion helps users understand the total cost of their purchases before they buy, improving customer experience and reducing post-purchase surprises.

  - exchange_rates (currency, rate, updated_at)
  - user_calculations (user_id, product, price, category, total, created_at)
  - users (basic user info)

Third-Party APIs:
  - Currency Exchange API (for real-time rates)
  - Saudi Customs API (for duty rate updates)
```

**Calculation Logic**:
```dart
class CostCalculator {
  double calculateTotalCost({
    required double productPrice,
    required double shippingCost,
    required String category,
    required String currency,
  }) {
    // 1. Convert to SAR if needed
    final priceInSAR = _convertToSAR(productPrice, currency);
    final shippingInSAR = _convertToSAR(shippingCost, currency);

    // 2. Get duty rate for category
    final dutyRate = _getDutyRate(category);

    // 3. Calculate customs duty
    final customsDuty = priceInSAR * dutyRate;

    // 4. Calculate VAT (15% on product + shipping + duty)
    final vatableAmount = priceInSAR + shippingInSAR + customsDuty;
    final vat = vatableAmount * 0.15;

    // 5. Total landed cost
    final total = priceInSAR + shippingInSAR + customsDuty + vat;

    return total;
  }

  CostBreakdown getBreakdown({
    required double productPrice,
    required double shippingCost,
    required String category,
    required String currency,
  }) {
    final priceInSAR = _convertToSAR(productPrice, currency);
    final shippingInSAR = _convertToSAR(shippingCost, currency);
    final dutyRate = _getDutyRate(category);
    final customsDuty = priceInSAR * dutyRate;
    final vatableAmount = priceInSAR + shippingInSAR + customsDuty;
    final vat = vatableAmount * 0.15;

    return CostBreakdown(
      productPrice: priceInSAR,
      shipping: shippingInSAR,
      customsDuty: customsDuty,
      vat: vat,
      total: priceInSAR + shippingInSAR + customsDuty + vat,
    );
  }
}
```

##### Challenges & Solutions

**Technical Challenges**:

**1. Accurate Currency Conversion**:

**Challenge**: Real-time exchange rates fluctuate constantly, and different sources provide different rates.

**Issues**:
- API rate limits on free currency services
- Rate differences between APIs
- Cache vs real-time trade-off
- Offline mode handling

**Solution**:
```dart
class ExchangeRateService {
  // Cache rates with TTL
  final Map<String, CachedRate> _rateCache = {};
  final Duration _cacheDuration = Duration(hours: 1);

  Future<double> getRate(String fromCurrency, String toCurrency) async {
    final cacheKey = '$fromCurrency-$toCurrency';

    // Check cache first
    if (_rateCache.containsKey(cacheKey)) {
      final cached = _rateCache[cacheKey]!;
      if (DateTime.now().difference(cached.timestamp) < _cacheDuration) {
        return cached.rate;
      }
    }

    // Fetch fresh rate
    final rate = await _fetchRateFromAPI(fromCurrency, toCurrency);

    // Cache it
    _rateCache[cacheKey] = CachedRate(rate, DateTime.now());

    return rate;
  }

  // Fallback to last known rate if API fails
  Future<double> _fetchRateFromAPI(String from, String to) async {
    try {
      final response = await _api.getExchangeRate(from, to);
      return response.rate;
    } catch (e) {
      // Use last cached rate or default
      return _rateCache['$from-$to']?.rate ?? 1.0;
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Complex Duty Rate Rules**:

**Challenge**: Customs duty rates vary significantly by product category and change periodically.

**Issues**:

- Multiple tax layers (duty + VAT)
- VAT calculated on (product + shipping + duty)
- Decimal precision

**Solution**:
```dart
class AccurateCalculator {
  // Use precise decimal calculations
  double _precise(double value) {
    return double.parse(value.toStringAsFixed(2));
  }

  CostBreakdown calculate(...) {
    // Step-by-step precision
    final price = _precise(productPrice);
    final shipping = _precise(shippingCost);
    final duty = _precise(price * dutyRate);
    final subtotal = _precise(price + shipping + duty);
    final vat = _precise(subtotal * 0.15);
    final total = _precise(subtotal + vat);

    return CostBreakdown(
      productPrice: price,
      shipping: shipping,
      customsDuty: duty,
      vat: vat,
      total: total,
    );
  }
}
```

#### 5.1.6 Cityfinder API
**Timeline Sort**: 6 | **Sort**: 7
**Period**: 2021-2022 (Developed during ShipTag evolution)
**Status**: Live & Active (Internal API)
**Platform**: RESTful API Service
**My Role**: Lead API Developer & System Architect
**Type**: Internal Infrastructure / Client API

##### Project Overview

**What is Cityfinder API?**

Cityfinder API is a specialized internal API service designed to solve a critical problem in Saudi Arabia's logistics industry: **the lack of a unified city naming and identification system** across multiple shipping carriers. It serves as an intelligent data normalization layer that translates between different carrier-specific city naming conventions and provides standardized location data.

**The Problem It Solved**:

While working with multiple shipping carrier integrations for ShipTag, I discovered a significant technical challenge:

**City Data Inconsistency Crisis**:
```
The Problem:
- Some carriers list 20-30 major cities
- Others (e.g., Aramex) list 400+ cities including towns and villages
- Each carrier uses different spellings for the same city:
  * "Medina" vs "Madinah" vs "AlMadinah" vs "Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah"
  * "Riyadh" vs "Riyadh City" vs "Al Riyadh" vs "الرياض"
  * "Jeddah" vs "Jiddah" vs "Jedda" vs "جدة"
- No unified city codes or standardization
- Branch locations vary by carrier
- Service availability differs per city per carrier
- Pickup/delivery capabilities inconsistent across carriers
```

**Without a solution, every time a user wanted to ship something:**
1. We'd have to manually map their city name to each carrier's specific naming
2. Check which carriers support that city
3. Verify pickup/delivery availability
4. Handle spelling variations and Arabic/English translations
5. Manage branch-specific information per carrier

**This created a massive integration complexity and poor user experience.**

**The Solution: Cityfinder API**

I created a unified API that acts as a single source of truth for all city-related data in Saudi Arabia's shipping ecosystem.

**Core Functionality**:
```
Input:
- User enters: "Madinah"
- Destination: "Riyadh"

Cityfinder API Returns:
{
  "origin": {
    "standardCode": "MED",
    "standardName": "Medina",
    "arabicName": "المدينة المنورة",
    "carriers": {
      "aramex": { "spelling": "Al Madinah", "pickup": true, "delivery": true, "branches": [...] },
      "dhl": { "spelling": "MEDINA", "pickup": true, "delivery": true, "branches": [...] },
      "smsa": { "spelling": "Madinah", "pickup": true, "delivery": true, "branches": [...] },
      "spl": { "spelling": "AlMadinah", "pickup": false, "delivery": true, "branches": [...] }
    },
    "supportedCarriers": ["aramex", "dhl", "smsa", "spl", "j&t"],
    "region": "Western",
    "coordinates": { "lat": 24.4672, "lng": 39.6114 }
  },
  "destination": {
    "standardCode": "RUH",
    "standardName": "Riyadh",
    ...
  },
  "availableRoutes": [
    { "carrier": "aramex", "estimatedDays": 1, "pickupAvailable": true },
    { "carrier": "dhl", "estimatedDays": 1, "pickupAvailable": true },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Essentially**: You can give Cityfinder API any spelling of any 2 cities (origin and destination), and it will:
1. Identify the cities correctly despite spelling variations
2. Tell you which carriers support that route
3. Provide carrier-specific spellings and preferences
4. Include branch information
5. Indicate pickup/delivery availability
6. Return standardized city codes for database consistency

You can then forward this detail to the **Labelmaker API** to generate the shipping label for the selected carrier. **It's THAT simple.**

#### 5.1.7 Labelmaker API
**Timeline Sort**: 7 | **Sort**: 8
**Period**: 2022-Present (Evolved from ShipTag core)
**Status**: Live & Critical Infrastructure
**Platform**: RESTful API Service (Microservice)
**My Role**: Core Developer & Integration Architect
**Type**: Internal Microservice / Client API

##### Project Overview

**What is Labelmaker API?**

Labelmaker API is a specialized microservice that serves as the **universal shipping label generation engine** for Digital Commerce's logistics platform. It abstracts the complexity of integrating with multiple shipping carrier APIs (Aramex, DHL, SMSA, J&T, UPS, FedEx, Saudi Post, etc.) into a single, simple-to-use API endpoint.

**Evolution from Monolith to Microservice**:

```
The Journey:
2019-2021: Label generation built into ShipTag app
           ↓ (Performance issues, code duplication)
2022:      Extracted to separate API service
           ↓ (Clean architecture, reusability)
Present:   Central label generation hub for entire ecosystem
```

**Why Labelmaker Was Extracted**:

Originally, label generation logic was embedded within the ShipTag project. As the development team, we recognized several critical issues:

1. **Code Duplication**: Same logic needed in app, web dashboard, backend, Chrome extension
2. **Maintenance Nightmare**: Updating carrier integration required changes across multiple codebases
3. **Performance Bottleneck**: Heavy carrier API calls blocked main application
4. **Scaling Challenges**: Couldn't independently scale label generation
5. **Third-Party Access**: Difficult to expose to external partners

**Solution**: **We (the dev team) moved it to a separate API** that handles the deep technical algorithm of integrating multiple carrier APIs together.

**The Problem It Solved**:

Generating a shipping label involves incredibly complex integration:

```
Without Labelmaker API:

For each carrier, you need to:
1. Know their specific API format (all different)
2. Handle their authentication (OAuth, API keys, tokens)
3. Map city names to their preferred spelling (Cityfinder API)
4. Convert weight units (kg, lbs, grams)
5. Format addresses per their requirements
6. Handle Arabic/English text fields
7. Calculate dimensions and volumetric weight
8. Set service types correctly
9. Handle customs declarations (for international)
10. Manage packaging types
11. Handle COD (Cash on Delivery) requirements
12. Parse their response (all different formats)
13. Handle errors and retry logic
14. Download and format PDF labels
15. Track label generation status
16. Handle webhooks for status updates

Multiply this by 8+ carriers = 8+ completely different implementations!
```

**With Labelmaker API**:

```json
POST /api/labelmaker/create

{
  "carrier": "aramex",
  "origin": "MED",
  "destination": "RUH",
  "weight": 2.5,
  "cod": 150,
  "contents": "Electronics",
  "shipperDetails": { ... },
  "recipientDetails": { ... }
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "labelUrl": "https://..../label.pdf",
  "trackingNumber": "1234567890",
  "estimatedDelivery": "2024-10-23",
  "cost": 25.50
}
```

**It simplifies the whole cumbersome process into a few simple parameters and voila! You can ship your packages.**

##### System Architecture

**Request Flow**:

```
1. Client Request (App/Web/Extension/3rd Party)
   ↓
2. Labelmaker API (Entry Point)
   ↓
3. Cityfinder API (Normalize city names)
   ↓
4. Carrier Selection Logic
   ↓
5. Carrier-Specific Adapter (Aramex/DHL/SMSA/etc.)
   ↓
6. Carrier API Call (External carrier systems)
   ↓
7. Response Processing & Label Generation
   ↓
8. Label Storage (S3/Cloud Storage)
   ↓
9. Response to Client (with label URL)
```

**Multi-Source Request Handling**:

Labelmaker API receives requests from multiple sources:

1. **ShipTag Mobile App**: Direct shipment creation
2. **Web Dashboard**: Bulk shipment processing
3. **Backend Admin**: Manual shipment entry
4. **Chrome Extension**: Quick label generation from browser
5. **Third-Party APIs**: Partner integrations
6. **Automated Systems**: Scheduled bulk processing

**Carrier Adapter Pattern**:

```php
interface CarrierAdapter {
  public function authenticate(): bool;
  public function createShipment(array $data): ShipmentResponse;
  public function getLabel(string $shipmentId): string;
  public function trackShipment(string $trackingNumber): TrackingData;
  public function cancelShipment(string $shipmentId): bool;
  public function validateAddress(array $address): bool;
}

Implementations:
- AramexAdapter
- DHLAdapter
- SMSAAdapter
- JAndTAdapter
- UPSAdapter
- FedExAdapter
- SaudiPostAdapter
```

Each carrier has its own adapter that translates the unified Labelmaker format into carrier-specific API calls.

#### 5.2.2 Majmooa e Naat
**Timeline Sort**: 9 | **Sort**: 17
**Period**: 2018-2019 (Development and Launch)
**Released**: February 21, 2019
**Status**: Live & Active
**Platform**: Mobile App (iOS & Android), Web
**My Role**: Lead Developer & Project Owner

##### Project Inspiration & Purpose

**What is Majmooa e Naat?**

Majmooa e Naat is a comprehensive mobile and web application dedicated to preserving and sharing Islamic poetry (Naat) in praise of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). The app serves as a digital library of Urdu Naatiya Kalaam (poetic collections) from various Islamic scholars and poets, presented in beautiful Unicode format with transliteration support.

**Core Purpose**:
> "A multi-lingual library to read and share Islamic poetry lyrics. Features a beautiful collection of Naat (Islamic poetry) in multiple languages with sharing capabilities."

**The Vision**:

To gather all Naatiya Deewans (poetry collections) of our respected scholars (Mashaykh) in one centralized digital platform, making them:
- Easily accessible to everyone worldwide
- Searchable and shareable
- Preserved in proper Unicode format
- Available with transliteration for non-Urdu readers
- Free for all Muslims

**Target Audience**:
- Lovers of Naat and Islamic poetry
- Students learning Urdu Naatiya Kalaam
- Reciters preparing for gatherings
- Researchers studying Islamic poetry
- Non-Urdu speakers learning through transliteration
- Anyone seeking spiritual connection through poetry

**Why This Project Matters**:

1. **Preservation**: Many valuable Naatiya Deewans exist only in physical books that are aging or out of print
2. **Accessibility**: Makes thousands of Naats available at fingertips
3. **Unicode Format**: Proper digital text format (not images) enables search and copy
4. **Transliteration**: Helps non-Urdu readers learn and recite
5. **Sharing**: Easy sharing of specific Naats on social media
6. **Spiritual Connection**: Facilitates love and connection with Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)

**Personal Motivation**:

Growing up in Madinah and being part of the Sunni community, I witnessed the deep love people have for Naat. However, finding specific Naats or collections was challenging. This project combines my technical skills with service to the Muslim community, creating a tool that brings spiritual benefit to thousands.

##### Project Naming Story

**The Honor of Naming**:

This project holds a special place in my heart not just for its purpose, but for the blessed honor it received.

**Historical Moment**:

- Location: Madinah Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia
- Blessed by: Hafiz e Millat Mufti Abdul Aziz Hanafi Sahb
- Event: Formal naming and blessing ceremony
- Significance: Spiritual endorsement and blessing

**What "Majmooa e Naat" Means**:
- **Majmooa**: Collection
- **Naat**: Poetry in praise of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)

This naming gave the project spiritual significance and credibility within the Sunni community, helping it gain acceptance and trust among users.

      .trim();
}

// Search algorithm
Future<List<Naat>> searchNaats(String query) async {
  final normalized = normalizeUrdu(query);

  // Search in database
  final results = await db.query(
    'naats',
    where: '''
      REPLACE(REPLACE(text_urdu, 'ً', ''), 'ٌ', '') LIKE ? OR
      text_roman LIKE ?
    ''',

**Period**: 2019-2020 (Development and Launch)
**Released**: April 5, 2020
**Status**: Live & Active
**Platform**: Mobile App (iOS & Android), Web
**My Role**: Lead Developer & Project Owner

##### Project Inspiration & Purpose

**What is iZiarat?**

iZiarat is a location-based mobile application that serves as a comprehensive digital guide to Islamic historic places worldwide. The app aims to gather pinpoint locations of Islamic historic sites on one unified platform, making it easier for Muslims to navigate through different historical places like mosques, shrines, museums, and other significant Islamic sites scattered across the world.

**Core Purpose**:
> "Enhance your travel with iZiarat which provides a visual representation of all nearby places drawn on a map. Perfect for pilgrims and travelers to discover and navigate to important Islamic sites."

**The Vision**:

To create the world's most comprehensive database of Islamic historic locations, helping Muslims:
- Discover Islamic heritage sites wherever they travel
- Navigate easily to historic mosques and shrines
- Learn about Islamic history through location-based context
- Contribute to preserving and documenting Islamic heritage
- Plan pilgrim ages and spiritual journeys
- Connect with Islamic history in their surroundings

**Target Audience**:
- Pilgrims visiting Makkah and Madinah
- Muslims traveling to historical Islamic cities
- Students of Islamic history
- Tourists visiting Muslim-majority countries
- Researchers documenting Islamic heritage
- Local Muslims discovering sites in their own cities

**Status**: Completed / Delivered to Client
**Platform**: Mobile App (Flutter - Android)
**My Role**: Full-Stack Mobile Developer

##### Client Background

**Client Need**: The client wanted to create a local business discovery platform specifically for Madinah, Saudi Arabia, with plans to expand across the Kingdom. The vision was to bridge the gap between local shops (which lack online presence) and consumers who struggle to discover these businesses.

**The Problem**:
- Local shops in Madinah aren't advertised like popular brands
- Google has limited information about small local businesses
- Residents and visitors can't easily discover local stores, cafes, services
- No centralized platform for local business information
- Community recommendations scattered across personal networks

**Client Vision**: Create a comprehensive platform that promotes the local market, connects consumers with local businesses, and builds a community around local commerce in Madinah and eventually across Saudi Arabia.

##### Project Overview

**Tagline**: *"Mirai - Partner for success"*

Mirai is a comprehensive local business discovery and community platform designed to connect consumers with local shops, restaurants, services, and venues in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. The app serves as a digital marketplace and community hub, featuring detailed business information, user reviews, discussions, and exclusive discounts.

**Core Mission**:
> "While Google has all the answers, it still lacks information when it comes to local shops. These shops are not advertised like other popular brands so people are not able to get to these shops quickly. That's where Mirai comes in!"

**Key Value Propositions**:

1. **Promoting Local Market**: Gather data from local shops and promote them on the platform so more people can discover them
2. **Vast Collection**: Provide detailed information and pictures of products sold by all types of stores
